## What is this project?
This project was created to help me learn docker, by creating a containerized development environment for a full stack goals application downloaded from a udemy course.

## How can I run it?
<ol>
<li>Ensure you have docker installed on your machine</li>
<li>Add your desired mongodb username and password to the backend.env and mongo.env files located in the env folder (And remove these from source control)</li>
<li>Run 'docker-compose up' from the root project directory</li>
</ol>
